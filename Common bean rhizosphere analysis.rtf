The files included in this repository are part of the manuscript currently in review: The rhizosphere of domestic Phaseolus vulgaris L. cultivars hosts a similar bacterial community in local agricultural lands\'94 by L\'f3pez-Romo et al., 2024. Here, we include methods of analysis of alpha and beta diversity of meta genomes from bulk soil and rhizosphere of three common bean cultivars (P. vulgaris cv Pinto Saltillo, Black and Bayo beans from Zacatecas, M\'e9xico. Other files are the differential analysis of the bulk soil and rhizosphere, and the methods associated to infer the a group of similar genera overrepresented in the rhizosphere of the three bean cultivars.}
